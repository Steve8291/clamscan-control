# SCAN ARRAYS
# Add directories you wish to scan.

#  only if their modification date is younger than EPOCHTIME
# Files in full_scan_array directories are always scanned in full.

# Time to roll back from the last scan time.
# Check the total time that a typical scan takes in the log file.
# This should be set so that any file created or modified during the scanning
#   process will be scanned during the next time.
# Set time in seconds. Default is 300 (5 min)

rollback=300


# This variable keeps track of the time of the last scan.
# For safety it subtracts 300 seconds (5 min) from current EPOCHTIME.
# You do not need to edit it. It is set automatically by clamscan.sh
# On first run EPOCHTIME=0 should be set.
# Setting EPOCHTIME=0 will cause a fullscan of all files in the arrays.
# This can take 6.5 hours or more.
